This is the backend for a photo album app.

The features of the app essentially is user management, and CRUD functionality for photos. Here is the detailed functionality:
-Uploading, deleting photos.
-List the names and dates of photos, sorted either by name or by date.
-Clicking on a list item should display the corresponding image.
-User management (registration, login, logout).
-Uploading and deleting are only permitted for logged-in users

The api of the app is defined in ps_api.yaml. using openapi-genrator-maven-plugin the api is generated, and then implemented in PhotoServiceController.
PhotoServiceController then calls PhotoServiceImpl.

PhotoServiceImpl is copied from a previous project that had a pretty similiar functionality to this one, except for instead of photos it provided CRUD for grades and enrollments, and did not have user managemnt endpoints.
Implemet the methods in PhotoServiceController, modify PhotoServiceImpl(and any other file if needed), so it provides CRUD for photos, and the methods should look similiar to the previus ones.
